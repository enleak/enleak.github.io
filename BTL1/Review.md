I want to begin by stating that this course and exam are of great significance to me. After failing the OSCP and PNPT, feelings of discouragement and thoughts of quitting quickly sprouted. Feeding into the negativity is simple especially after the amount of time, money and energy spent learning. However, a common theme that never fails to be mentioned is the persistence needed in order to learn, become an asset and succeed in this field. Thank you ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ [Josh Beaman](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joshuabeaman/) for the great course and great thanks to my mentors and friends that help encourage me.. With that being said, I will now transition into discussing what resources I used for the exam, what was my studying experience like, and overall, what value did passing this certification bring to me, hope you enjoy!



Regarding the structure of the certification, it covers six domains which are:

+	Domain 1 â€“ Security Fundamentals
+	Domain 2 â€“ Phishing Analysis
+	Domain 3 â€“ Threat Intelligence
+	Domain 4 â€“ Digital Forensics
+	Domain 5 â€“ SIEM
+	Domain 6 â€“ Incident Response

And some of the tools that are covered in the course are:

+	Autopsy, 
+	Browser History Capturer, 
+	Browser History Viewer, 
+	DeepBlueCLI, 
+	DomainTools, 
+	Event Viewer,
+	FTK Imager,
+	JumpList Explorer, 
+	KAPE, 
+	MISP, 
+	OpenCTI, 
+	PECmd, 
+	PhishTool, 
+	ProcDump, 
+	Sigma, 
+	Snort,
+	Splunk,
+	Suricata, TheHive5, VirusTotal, Volatility, WannaBrowser, Windows File Analyzer, Wireshark and much more.

Additionally, the exam is structured so that the students are able to start their practical 24-hour incident response exam immediately from the BTL1 course within 12 months of purchase. Most importantly, Students will have access to a cloud lab via an in-browser session for up to 24 hours and must complete and answer twenty task-based questions. In regards to passing, once the student has answered all the questions, they are able to submit the exam to receive immediate grading, feedback, and:

Moving on, the resources recommended to use to prepare for the certification along with the browser labs and content that were provided by Security Blue Team are Tryhackme, more specifically their SOC Level 1 and their Cyber Defense paths. Now regarding the learning paths, there is five areas that stand out to me that a friend created a GitHub for so definitely a big shoutout to my friend for creating that and they are listed below:

### Phishing

Last but not least, it took me a total of five and a half hours to complete the entire exam, but that time can range in terms of your comfort level with the material. Now, I will provide some tips and advice that do not violate the NDA pertaining to this exam.

First, I would definitely recommend redoing the labs provided in the course and on Tryhackme for practical experience. These types of exams require you to use your critical thinking skills, so the answers may not be straightforward. Get comfortable and confident with the material from a hands-on perspective and understand the concepts behind those tools as well.

In cybersecurity and any field, it is crucially important to build up your social network because it can open doors to opportunities that you thought were impossible to achieve. I recommend joining Slack channels or Discord servers that align with your field. Specifically, in cybersecurity, the following ones have really helped me prepare for this exam. Please note that this is not an exhaustive list, so I encourage you to explore and join other Discord servers or Slack channels that are best suited for you:

To keep you inspired, I want to share this quote with you: "If you believe in yourself and feel confident in yourself, you can do anything" - Karlie Kloss. It's normal to feel that the exam is daunting and/or to feel burnout. However, remember that the certification can open doors for you in the cybersecurity field, stay motivated and strive to do your best.
