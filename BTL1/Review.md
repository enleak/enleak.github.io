First of all, I want to thank Security Blue Team for the  amazing exam and learning experience, I'd also like to thank those who supported me on this journey. With that being said, I will now transition into discussing what resources I used for the exam, what was my studying experience like, and overall, what value did passing this certification bring to me, hope you enjoy!

Regarding the structure of the certification, it covers six domains which are:

+	Domain 1 – Security Fundamentals
+	Domain 2 – Phishing Analysis
+	Domain 3 – Threat Intelligence
+	Domain 4 – Digital Forensics
+	Domain 5 – SIEM
+	Domain 6 – Incident Response

And some of the tools that are covered in the course are:

+	Autopsy, 
+	Browser History Capturer, 
+	Browser History Viewer, 
+	DeepBlueCLI, 
+	DomainTools, 
+	Event Viewer,
+	FTK Imager,
+	JumpList Explorer, 
+	KAPE, 
+	MISP, 
+	OpenCTI,

+	ProcDump, 
+	Sigma, 
+	Snort,

  Additionally, the exam is structured so that the students are able to start their practical 24-hour incident response exam immediately from the BTL1 course within 12 months of purchase. Most importantly, Students will have access to a cloud lab via an in-browser session for up to 24 hours and must complete and answer twenty task-based questions. In regards to passing, once the student has answered all the questions, they are able to submit the exam to receive immediate grading, feedback, and:
