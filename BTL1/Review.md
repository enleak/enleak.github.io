First of all, I want to thank Security Blue Team for the really amazing exam and learning experience for preparing and taking the examination because it truly opened my eyes, and I found the experiences to be truly advantageous and definitely one that I would do again. Also, I want to thank those who supported me on my journey to get to this point because the content was very comprehensive and the labs really tested my ability to not only understand the material, but also to apply it from a practical standpoint as well, so I want to give a big shoutout to all those who helped me along my path. With that being said, I will now transition into discussing what resources I used for the exam, what was my studying experience like, and overall, in terms of value what did passing this certification bring to me, so hope you enjoy reading my blog and let us do this.
